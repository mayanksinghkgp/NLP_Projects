### Scripts and short projects related to Natural Language processing  

**1. Chatbot**  
A chatbot userinterface trained on a simple ANN using NLTK and tensorflow libraries for training and Tkinter for the GUI.  
[Details of the project here](Chatbot/Readme.md)

**2. Consumer complaint classification**  
Data downloaded form the US consumer complaints database with over 2.3 Million data points. Used NLTK, Keras and sklearn to perform classification of the customer narratives
in to different product classes with the help of Embedding and LSTM layers.

**3. Corona Fake news identification**  
Dataset contains articles form different sources and also the label 'fake' or 'true'. Data is preprocessed using regex and vectorized with tfidf using PorterStemmer. This post
processed data and the labels are fed to a Logistic Regression model and tuned for the predictions. Model gives a F1 score of .92 for both classes.
