'' Additionally, according to Section D ( Terms of Repayment ), Navient was required to send me a statement setting forth the repayment schedule on or before the date of repayment. ( See Section D ( 4 ) ). To date, no such repayment schedule has been received electronically or by mail. \n",

The Separation Period should have lasted until XX/XX/XXXX under the terms of the Promissory Note described above. However, contrary to this agreement, without notice, Navient began attempting to collect on full monthly payments in XXXX of XXXX. When I discovered that Navient reported late payments to the Credit Bureaus in XX/XX/XXXX of that year, I immediately took action on my account and began repayment while also attempting to dispute the subject of this present Complaint directly with Navient. \n",

In closing, Navient has acted in bad faith at every stage of repayment and the language of our agreement clearly shows that the 8 missed or late payments reflected on my Credit Reports should be removed immediately.\n",
