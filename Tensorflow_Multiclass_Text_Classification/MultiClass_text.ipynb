I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and after several attempts of giving my full name, nothing came up in their system. I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}. Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back. The issue im having is this representative at XXXX XXXX played blind to obvious fraud and let an innocent person make a payment on someone elses debt and i want my money back.   \n",

       "57448  I am attempting to make a payment toward my student loans on the Nelnet website today, XX/XX/20, and Nelnet will not allow me to post the payment sooner than XX/XX/20. By the time the payment posts, 2-3 days of additional interest will have accrued and my payments will apply more to interest than is due today, the day that I'm attempting to pay. My understanding was that I could make a payment at any time but this does not appear to be true. The funds are available in my bank account today regardless of whether Nelnet can collect over the weekend. I should not be penalized for this. \\n\\nI submitted complaint XXXX in XXXX for other deceptive practices with Nelnet.

I tried cancelling the said timeshare account several times because of these fees that were never mentioned at the initiation. My account was debited to pay for the timeshare fees without my knowledge or consent several times. I tried correcting this with Wells Fargo bank with no avail.

Also in their fine prints they did not list the states that were eligible so who would know if they don\\'t qualify? This is scam by misleading people in believing they will would qualify so they will open an account with them.

       "        b'I contacted Capital One regarding the interest on a closed account. The agreement was for 93 a month, however the fees alone total half of that payment, It is simply too high. I will never get ahead. I contacted them to remove the late fee and also help me with the balance but they refused. I need assistance with this bill because at this rate I will owe them even when I die.',\n",
       "        b\"I contacted my mortgage company SPS in XX/XX/2020 to obtain a forbearance for my mortgage loan due to my wife 's wages being reduced to COVID-19. I was told on the phone call with the call center agent that I had been approved for a 90-day forbearance plan. I received a letter dated XX/XX/2020 stating the terms of my forbearance. The forbearance terms in the letter stated that my forbearance began with the XX/XX/2020 monthly payment, but I had already made that payment back on XX/XX/2020. My loan was current and due for the XX/XX/2020 monthly payment when I requested assistance. I had thought that my forbearance would be for the XX/XX/2020, XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020 payments based on the verbal discussion with the call center agent. Yet, the terms list XX/XX/2020, XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020 payments as covered under the forbearance and a balloon payment due XX/XX/2020. I am asking for assistance from the CFPB to have SPS honor the terms of the forbearance that I had agreed to in my call and have my first payment after my forbearance ends be XX/XX/2020. I believe that SPS is being deceptive in its assistance offerings. As a borrower who was negatively impacted by COVID-19 I don't feel that SPS is truly helping borrowers.\",\n",
